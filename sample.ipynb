    "The Martini coarse-grained (CG) model was originally developed for lipids[1,2]. The underlying philosophy of Martini is to build an extendable CG model based on simple modular building blocks and to use only few parameters and standard interaction potentials to maximise applicability and transferability. Martini uses an approximate 4:1 atomistic (heavy atoms) to CG bead mapping and in version 2.0[2] 18 bead types were defined to represent chemical characteristics of the beads. The CG beads have a fixed size and interact using an interaction map with 10 different interaction strengths. Due to the modularity of Martini, a large set of different lipid types has been parameterized. Their parameters are available in the Martini Lipidome, see the Martini lipid topology section. In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up lipid-water system simulations with the lipidome, with a focus on bilayers. You will also study a number of standard bilayer properties."
